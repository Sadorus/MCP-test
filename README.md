# MCP-test

A test repository for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for AI coding assistants that enables them to access and manipulate a user's development environment. MCP allows AI assistants to:

- Read files in your codebase
- Write/edit files
- Run scripts and diagnostics
- Understand your project structure
- Execute language servers for better code understanding

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a testing ground for MCP functionality and integration. It can be used to:

1. Test MCP server implementations
2. Experiment with MCP client integrations
3. Develop tools that work with the MCP ecosystem
4. Document best practices for MCP usage

## Resources

Here are some useful resources for learning more about MCP:

- [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://github.com/liveblocks/model-context-protocol)
- [Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers) - A curated list of MCP servers

## Getting Started

To use this repository with an MCP-compatible editor:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open it in your MCP-compatible editor (e.g., Cursor, VS Code with MCP extension)
3. Start experimenting with AI-assisted coding
